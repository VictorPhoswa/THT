#The code does not work as it is supposed to
#Code is Understandable
#Indetation Error
#unident does not match any outer indentation
#The passed list(Strs) is not arranged orderly as required for desired output
#The sort function is not passed any argument(counter vairable i)
#The loop has complexity O(N) as we iterate through each string.
#Then, we sort each string in O(Nlog‚Å°N) time. using the in built function
